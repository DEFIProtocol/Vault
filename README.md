# Vault

Contract is currently broken or incomplete. Originally intended on using this contract in the gridLock repository. However, once I realized the extent of gas fees began working on other project. Vaults take in token and release the tokens at a given moment. Typically they are stored for a time period, but I intended on releasing them upon an event in order to complete the limit order functionality.
